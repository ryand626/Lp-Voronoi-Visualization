## Application Instructions
- To create a vertex, click with your mouse
- To delete a vertex, right click on the vertex you wish to remove
- The horizontal slider on the bottom changes the size of the radii growign from the vertices
- The vertical slider on the right adjusts the p-values. The slider begins with p=2, the Euclidean norm. Changing the p-value will change the type of shape growing out of the vertices; as shown in the picture above.
